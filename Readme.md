## Adding menu bar..

## Menu bar ... provides a feature implementation.

## Installation(program persists when installed until uninstalled.)
1) clone down project
2) cd project<br>
<pre><b>install and start</b></pre>
3) ./app/install_driver.sh<br>
<pre><b>uninstall and stop</b></pre>
4) ./app/uninstall_driver.sh

## how program works...

4) note: need to ... write application name ... upon search will load ctl.
